# ISBN Check Digit Verifier

## Introduction

From Wikipedia: 

> The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is a unique numeric commercial
> book identifier.

> An ISBN is assigned to each edition and variation (except reprintings) of a
> book. For example, an ebook, a paperback, and a hardcover edition of the same
> book would each have a different ISBN. The ISBN is 13 digits long if assigned
> on or after 1 January 2007, and 10 digits long if assigned before 2007. The
> method of assigning an ISBN is nation based, and varies from state to state
> often depending on how large the publishing industry is within a state.

## Goal

This seemed like a small enough problem to solve with many languages. 

Depending on the number of digits in the ISBN, a different algo is used. They
are located within their respective folders.
